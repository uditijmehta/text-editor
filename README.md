# Real-time Collaborative Text Editor

This project is a simple real-time collaborative text editor, similar to Google Docs. The text editor is implemented as a web application using React for the frontend and Node.js (with TypeScript) for the backend. Real-time communication is enabled by Socket.IO.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm must be installed on your system. You can download them [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone 
```

2. Install the dependencies for the server:

```bash
cd collab-text-editor/server
npm install
```

3. Install the dependencies for the client:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Run the server:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

2. In a separate terminal, run the client:

```bash
cd client
npm install --legacy-peer-deps @material-ui/core
npm start
```

The application should now be running. You can test it by opening two browser windows and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in both. Any text you type in one window should immediately appear in the other.

## Architecture

The application uses React for the frontend to take advantage of its simple and declarative UI components. The backend is implemented in Node.js with TypeScript for its support of static typing, which improves the reliability and maintainability of the code.

Socket.IO is used for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and each connected client. Whenever a client makes a change to the text, it sends a message to the server, which then broadcasts the change to all other connected clients.

This architecture was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in supporting real-time collaboration. Socket.IO makes it easy to implement the real-time communication required for this feature.

## Trade-offs and Future Improvements

The current implementation broadcasts every change to all connected clients, which can lead to inefficiencies when there are many clients or when changes are made frequently. A more sophisticated approach, such as Operational Transformation or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types, could be used to improve performance and handle conflicts more gracefully.

The current implementation also lacks persistence. In a real product, changes would need to be saved to a database to allow for recovery of previous work and collaboration across multiple sessions.

Finally, the application currently lacks any form of user authentication or session management. In a real product, these features would be necessary to ensure security and provide a personalized experience for each user.
